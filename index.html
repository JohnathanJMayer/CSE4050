<h1>How to build your first studio</h1> 

<p>
In my opinion, every recording artist should have their own personal recording studio for multiple reasons.
It gives you the ability to make music on your own time without having to rent out studio time and pay for a producer and engineer.
You can either use your money to pay for studio time over and over again, 
or you can take that money and build your own personal home studio.
This web page will show you everything you need to build your own personal home studio at different price points.
