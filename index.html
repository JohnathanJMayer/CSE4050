<h1>How to build your first studio</h1> 

<p>
In my opinion, every recording artist should have their own personal recording studio for multiple reasons.
It gives you the ability to make music on your own time without having to rent out studio time and pay for a producer and engineer.
You can either use your money to pay for studio time over and over again, 
or you can take that money and build your own personal home studio.
This web page will show you everything you need to build your own personal home studio at different price points.

<h1>What you will need:</h1> 

<h1>Computer</h1> 

While Mac is generally the standard for most studios, it doesn't matter if you use Windows or Mac. As long as your computer has a lot of RAM and storage and a good processor, you'll be fine.

<h1>Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)</h1> 

This is the program you will use to make your music. There are many great and affordable options out there, and almost all of them have free demos available online.
I personally use FL Studio, but other good options include Logic Pro X, Ableton, Reaper, Cubase, Reason, and Pro Tool, which is the industry standard in almost every recording studio.
As long as you have a good computer and a DAW, you are ready to start making music!

<h1>Headphones</h1>

You're next investment should be a good pair of headphones. If you're planning on mixing your music your self, then I would recommend spending around $100-150 on your headphones.
Some options I would recommend would be the Audio Technica MTH-40x and MTH-50x headphones as well as the Shure SRH440 and SHR480 headphones.
If you're only using them for recording and tracking then I would say to spend at least $50 on a pair of good headphones,
 and for $50 I would recommend picking up a pair of the Audio Technica MTH-20x headphones.

<h1>Audio Interface</h1> 

An audio interface is a little box that connects to your computer via USB and is used to record audio including vocals and instruments. 
A great intro interface is the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, it is very simple and has just one microphone input and one instrument input. 
Unless you are planning on recording drums, this is perfect for most people's home studio setup. 
If you choose to upgrade you're interface down the road, weather that be for more inputs or higher quality preamps, I would recommend the Focusrite Clarrett+ and 
Universal Audio Apollo lines of interfaces.

<h1>Microphone</h1>

They're are many different types of microphones available on the market, but if you are looking for 1 good microphone to use for multiple different sources, I would recommend picking up a 
Large Diaphram Condenser microphone. A great budget option is the Audio Technica AT-2020 for $100 or the Aston Element for $200. However if you are able to spend a little more money, 
 I would recommend the AKG C214 for $420 or the Aston Spirit for $450. 

<h1>Studio Monitors</h1> 

Monitors are what you will primarily be mixing on, and they are something you do not want to cheap out on. It's better to save your money and get something great than spend too little
have to upgrade soon after. I recommend the Adam T series and Yamaha HS series monitors.
